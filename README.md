Adds a strikethrough toggle button to the Thunderbird compose toolbar. This is added as an extension and as such is not an integrated component of the Thunderbird toolbar. That is why it sits at the far right on the toolbar and not next to the B/I/U buttons. Adding it as an integrated button would require modifying the Thunderbird program itself. Maybe the Thunderbird team will take notice and add this button to their integrated toolbar as it used to be in the past.
